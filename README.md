# Introduction

We developed this solution during a 24h Hackathon by JCDecaux. We were asked to solve an allocation problem, which consisted in allocating faces to a maximum of client (named brief). Constraints were to answer one brief at a time without knowing about following ones, and to spread equally throughout the territory.

# Results

This algorithm generated the best results in terms of client satisfaction (number of client who had their campaign accepted), and revenue.
